(article "Hello world!" '(english meta)
  (paragraph
    "Hello world! I'm Jérôme, professional developer and hacker.")
  (paragraph
    "This is my brand new blog where I talk about " 'slow-tech ", " 'programming ", " 'feminism ", " 'ecology ", "
    "and sometimes metaphysical aspects of life...")
  (paragraph
    "Technically speaking, I wanted to make a blog from scratch using " 'Racket ", to see how simple "
    "and stupid you can keep a web server when using a " 'lisp " language.")
  (paragraph
    "Most importantly, I wanted to write about things that please and displease me in this world.")
  (fold)
  (paragraph
    "My head spins every time I stumble upon a new evidence that humans are brutal, ruthless and unable to live together, "
    "while in the same time being forced by their very nature to actually live together.")
  (paragraph
    "In order to understand why I am touched by this aching feeling, I wanna write about every thing that triggers it. "
    "I want to talk about " 'work ", especially work in the IT industry, and how we are pointlessly building "
    "hopes in machines to save us, as if it was a new bio-mechanical god.")
  (paragraph
    "I want to talk about being a white european man with full " 'privileges " in a society that pushes me to destroy others and aim for the top.")
  (paragraph
    "I want to talk about people convinced that we are building a better world "
    "while we are in fact shitting our pants and trying random stuff (alas it is not always a bad thing).")
  (paragraph
    "I also wanted to write about stuff I like or love in this world, "
    "because I want to focus my life on those and I can't find them if I don't put words on them.")
  (paragraph
    "I want to talk about taking it slow, or how you can have fun building small and environment-friendly computers (see the " 'slow-tech " tag).")
  (paragraph
    "I want to talk about how the 'hottest new technology available' is far from being artificial intelligence nor the latest smartphone on the market, "
    "but discoveries made in the 60's by passionate programmers and thinkers. "
    "I want to stress out to the IT croud around the fact that IT is moving SLOW, very, very SLOW. "
    "So please let the hype pass by, and focus on what's essential and really makes the core of your job.")
  (paragraph
    "I want to talk about relationships, love, how difficult it is to study human relations, and how wonderful the world would be if we understood them better.")
  (paragraph
    "I want to talk about preserving the one and only planet we have, and get humanity into a sane relationship with it. "
    "We're plunging towards an ecological recession, and the more we are prepared, the less painfull it'll be (especially if we understand better how to live together)." (n)
    "This is why I think studying love, sex, gender, and other social constructions is deeply linked to ecology, "
    "our interactions with the planet, and the management and regulation of our waste." (n)
    "If we don't understand ourselves, we cannot understand nor question our place on Earth.")
  (paragraph
    "It won't immediately be good, well written and documented, but I hope this blog will bring me confidence, "
    "will make me want to fight for better rights, and hopefully will make me learn a thing or two.")
  (paragraph
    "Feel free to pick up whatever you please, get inspired, and share your thoughts around."))
